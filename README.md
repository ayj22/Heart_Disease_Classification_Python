Based on the attributes provided can we predict if the patient have heart-disease or not.
Building Machine Learning Model for Predicting Heart Disease

In this notebook we are going to apply Python based machine learning libraries to build a model capable of predicting if a person has heart disease or not based on their medical information.

Road map step by step:

#Step 1: Defining the problem
> Based on the attributes provided can we predict if the patient have heart-disease or not.

#Step 2: Data
> The original source of data is from UCI Machine Learning Repositary.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

> We have downloaded the data from kaggle.
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

#Step 3: Evaluation
> Our bentch mark for this model is to achieve atleast 95% accuracy to pursue the project further

#Step 4: Features
Information of all the data attributes with proper classification.
1. age - age in years 
2. sex - (1 = male; 0 = female) 
3. cp - chest pain type 
    * 0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart
    * 1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart
    * 2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)
    * 3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease
4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
    * anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern
5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
    * serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides
    * above 200 is cause for concern
6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) 
    * '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes
7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
    * 0: Nothing to note
    * 1: ST-T Wave abnormality
        - can range from mild symptoms to severe problems
        - signals non-normal heart beat
    * 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
        - Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber
8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved 
9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 
10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
    * looks at stress of heart during excercise
    * unhealthy heart will stress more
11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    * 0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)
    * 1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)
    * 2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart
12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
    * colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through
    * the more blood movement the better (no clots)
13. thal - thalium stress result
    * 1,3: normal
    * 6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now
    * 7: reversable defect: no proper blood movement when excercising 
14. target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no) (= the predicted attribute)

**Note:** No personal identifiable information (PPI) can be found in the dataset.

#Step 6: Experimentation
